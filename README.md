# JuliaDeploymentMethods

This is a repository to document various methods of "deploying" Julia "applications" by providing concrete examples and links to useful resources.

Listing some of the methods here:

1. **Deploying on server**: Deploying an application (within something like a docker container) on a server and quering it using web APIs

1. **Deploying in the form of desktop applications**: Something like a standalone executable that can be downloaded and run without having to install Julia on the machine.

1. **Deployable notebooks**: Deploying an application as a Pluto/Jupyter notebook that can be run using a web browser on a cloud based service.
